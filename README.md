## Introduction
* Medical wire is a kind of medical device which plays an important role in surgery, infusion and other operation. Therefore, the wire manufacturing process is extremely critical. But there are dozens of variables which may have an effect on this process with different process levels. It is difficult to test each variable because of limitation on cost and the number of materials.
This article presents fractional factorial design and full factorial design analyze a wire manufacturing process. Data of experiment was collected at China - japan friendship hospital. The study results show the variables which will have an effect on manufacturing process to explain the relationship between variables and strength.
